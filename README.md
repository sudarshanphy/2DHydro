# 2DHydro
This is a code that I wrote for fun. I performed a few standard simulations with it.
The parameter files for these simulations are provided in the repo.

## Running Code
The code can be run with
`./setup [arguments]`
For help use `./setup --help`

## Sedov-Blast wave problem
Simulation is performed using a `400 x 600` cell grid with 2 different reconstruction method: `WENO3` and `WENO5`. Need to fix the scale on python plot.

## Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem
Performed using a `256 x 256` grid.

# 2D MHD
Ideal MHD equations are being added to the code. 

## 2D Orszag-Tang Vortex problem
Perfomed using a `512 x 512` grid.
