# 2DHydro
This is a code that I wrote for fun. I performed a few standard simulations with it.
The parameter files for these simulations are provided in the repo.

## Sedov-Blast wave problem
Simulation is performed using a `512 x 512` cell grid with 2 different reconstruction method: `WENO3` and `WENO5`. Need to fix the scale on python plot.

## Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem
Performed using a `256 x 256` grid.

## Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem
Performed using a `100x300` grid.
